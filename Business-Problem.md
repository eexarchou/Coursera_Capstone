# Business problem 

Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, has a population of 1.6M people and is at the heart of
a metropolitan region of 5M inhabitants.

The cosmopolitan, diverse and intercultural spirit of Barcelona can be seen in the fact that
18.5% of the cityâ€™s residents are foreign, exceeding 300.000 residents. 

Despite the large population there is only a handful of Greek restaurants which offer a high
quality menu for a middle-high level target audience. 

The stake holder wants to fill this gap by opening a greek restaurant targeting a more
gourmet clientele. Criteria to be considered: 

- Density of other restaurants 
- Other greek restaurants in the neighborhood  which are competition. 
- Polulation density 
- Accessibility (metro stops, parking spots) 
- Polulation income in the surrounding area
- Middle-high level hotels in the area that can also potentially bring more clients.
